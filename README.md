We were given a code to find the roots of a quadratic equation with two varables.We use scanner to allow the user to enter the value of a,b and c.We defined the coeffient as y,x1 and x2, and then we calculated the discriminant (b*b - 4ac) to determine the nature of the roots . Unfortunately along the way we encountered some few problems and one of them was that as we ran the code for the first time , our output values were incorrect but we did not give up , instead we fixed those errors and fortunately enough we got the correct output values . All in all this is how we did our project.
